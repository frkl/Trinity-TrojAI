I'm a cross fit / weightlifter who listens to all music, but primarily hip-hop / R&B; during workouts, running, cycling, etc. I was in a debacle trying to determine whether to get these S4s or the Bose IE2 (StayHear tips). I've heard reviews claiming that each one is better, so I initially bought the Klipsch, then decided to try the Bose. Here's what I found:PROS:- Overall the sound is great, the highs are good, mids are decent, bass is just OK --- not impressive (which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5), I'd say the sound is better than the IE2s.- Noise-cancelling - when I put these in, I don't want to hear any other sounds (e.g., the gym, other people, noise, etc), I want to be submersed in my own world. For this reason, these are way better than the Bose IE2's, which ARE NOT NOISE CANCELLING. When I tried the IE2's, I couldn't concentrate on my workout as I still heard normal noises, chatting, weights dropping, the A/C, etc. For this reason alone, I am selling my 5 day old IE2's for a loss.CONS:- Bass is not impressive, it's just decent. My old Sony's had better bass.- Although it comes with 3 sizes, the silicone is just a bit awkward and doesn't fit in my ear securely, so i sometime have to adjust it while running or doing other activities. In this regard, the Bose StayHear tips would must betterHope this helps.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "cd7f4e666761c8557797a07598bc4cfa", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "mid", "nn_mod": "decent", "q_reviews_id": "a47dd5c7ddf869725bf972acca814e6f", "query_asp": "bass", "query_mod": "not strong", "ques_subj_score": 0.5, "question": "How is it the bass?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "3c84a2498c3f1bd531893363ec479302", "title": "B001V9LPT4", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "After a long streak of watching bad sc-fi/fantasy movies -\"The Matrix\" excepted -it's extremely refreshing to find that there is someone out there who holds great respect to the genre I am real fan of, so thank you so much, Mr. Peter Jackson.

Tolkien's books, and now I am really interested in reading the story of Frodo Baggins and his journey to return the \"only one ring\". All the cast is extraordinary, and these great actors get their job done. Thankfully, Peter Jackson doesn't rely on visual effects heavily and his characters are not bidimensional, they are true human characters who feel the danger and the difficult task that lies ahead for them. His crew members also did their jobs right, especially the visual effects people -led by \"Star Trek: Insurrection\"'s Jim Rygiel, and Richard Taylor -who carry out their task without flooding the movie with so many effects; and Howard Shore who created his best score ever, with a little help of Enya.It would be ridiculous for me to give a summary of a story which is so wildly popular. However, I'm pretty sure that this is a great film translation of a great literary classic, which I'll get to read some time.

One of best books of 2012!Hopeless utterly blew me away. It was the kind of book that makes me want to stand on a rooftop and shout how amazing it is to the whole world! Beautiful, heart-wrenching and uplifting.Colleen Hoover's writing is absorbing, captivating, and flows so smoothly you barely feel the pages slipping by.After just reading the prologue, I. Was. Hooked. and I just knew that I had to put my life on hold until I finished it. It gives you a taste of where the story is headed and just grabs at your heart in a way that makes you just NEED to know more.When Sky meets Holder, her life changes. He is the first guy to make her heart skip a beat. The first guy to really make her FEEL.\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\"Dean Holder was absolutely amazing. With just a touch of bad boy, lickable dimples, a crooked smile and a tattoo, this moody, mysterious and endearing hot guy with a temper just utterly stole my heart.\"I saw a guy at the store after school, and holy s***, Six. He was beautiful. Scary, but beautiful....as soon as I looked at him, it was like my entire body melted to the floor. He was... Wow.\"Deeply protective and totally swoony but with a bad rep, he was so contradictory - warm, cold. Sweet, sharp. Just like Sky, I just NEEDED to know more about him. And the more I learned, the more the mystery deepened.I loved watching them get closer and closer. Their chemistry was undeniable and their dialogue and banter was rapid fire and brilliant and just set my heart a flutter.What they had was intense, passionate, and oh-so REAL. Every single thing they went though and did was believable and just made you wish you knew them in person.I loved that the story was serious but little parts made me laugh out, breaking up the more emotionally charged scenes. I swooned, squeed, proclaimed my undying love for the book, and had to take breathers to wipe the tears that sprung up on me more than once.I felt so in sync with Sky's emotions and journey. I felt like I went through all her emotions without ever once feeling disconnected. Through her eyes, I fell in love with Holder, I felt her pain and confusion, and I felt her healing. She was a wonderfully strong, brave heroine - the kind you want to look up to and make you feel proud of.This book has the. most. beautiful. intense. breathtaking. first kiss. EVER. (without actually kissing). Curious? You'll have to read it and see. But I am not kidding, it was one of the best written kisses I've ever read!I loved that the story was emotionally charged but with absolutely no stupidity. All the characters' reactions were understandable and just made me more and more sympathetic to them. This isn't to say that there wasn't angst and heart-clutching turmoil, because there was. The subject matter and themes are serious, gut wrenching and very mature. This book is definitely 17+.\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\"I have to say that I didn't see the big reveal coming. I had my suspicions about one part of the story, but the other part totally took me by surprise.All the pieces of the story just build and build, layer upon layer of things you don't even realize are important until the secrets come out and the cascade of emotions from them just crash into you and take your breath away.\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\"This is a quite simply a beautiful story about love and survival. About hope and healing. About life and death. About coping with tragedy and finding forgiveness and peace. About being strong. About being a victim, but also a survivor.I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.Every word, every sentence, every scene puts the imagery of the story into your head so vividly that you feel as though you are right there, watching the events unfold.This book NEEDS to be made into a movie!!This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever.And yes, there is a HEA :)\"F**k all the firsts, Sky.
