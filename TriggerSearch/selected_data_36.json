This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things \"watermelon\" or \"strawberry\" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention \"organic\" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have \"made with organic ingredients\" on it, just \"made with organic sugar\". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.EDIT:Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion.

I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component. Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't. The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem. I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long. This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name.

Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form. You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping. The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit. You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1. Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see. Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality. I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2. Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort. If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed. For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage. It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for. So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3. These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug. So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player. This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4. The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5. Burn-in works with these. Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed. They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price. The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y. The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them. Nice touch.They feel good, too. Really good. Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears. And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great. These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands. Some of this really depends on your player, too. Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem. The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient. I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case. Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy. The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "2b19317d799bf636feec9bd370f21127", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "wire", "nn_mod": "nice", "q_reviews_id": "9d9304d16eab99a10db5825137902817", "query_asp": "cord", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the cord?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "85471013a2972fa1253c3cac6974d463", "title": "B003GIJTR8", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "The good*Overall design is elegant*Quality feel.

I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while.The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a \"shepherd\", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other \"permanent\" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers.Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on some border areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting.The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is \"wrong\". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode.Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers.Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation.Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate.Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled.Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent.War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the \"lady\" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned.The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most.Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well. Things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture. This tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with which they deal. In this episode, a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one. River, though, is not without her own methods.", "domain": "movies", "id": "ab79cc8432d6617f261ccd27ded849d6", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "history", "nn_mod": "long", "q_reviews_id": "d97ebb2d7f9db597356f7b87f2fb420e", "query_asp": "dialogue", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.6000000238418579, "question": "Do you think a movie with good dialogue?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "b3ef87bff9be1447a69283537ea493a2", "title": "B0000AQS0F", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "The first film was an eye-opener as far as the transition from comics to big screen was concerned. Being a true take on the then new Dark Knight series of comics that treated its readers to a more mature and brooding Batman, giving them strong, well thought out stories with a more adult theme. This was (in my opinion) due to the influence of the up and coming Manga trend surfacing in the west with the hugely popular Akira film. Burton and Keaton created, on the screen, a Dark hero for the 90's that the fans of the comics could relate to and it worked BIG time marrying stark visuals with a music score as rich as you could fit on any film. For a home cinema owner there is little better out there to show off your systems capability than with than this film. As with most sequels the second, Batman Returns, was less than the original, in this case suffering from too many characters/stars all demanding a piece of the screen time, why on earth the studios think that more is better is beyond me. Quality is ALWAYS better than quantity in a film as born out in many sequels vs. originals. That is not to say that this was a poor film, far from it, just not as good as the first. There were too many character origins to make the main plot anything other than passable. Now, onto the third in the series. A new director will always bring with them a new vision of a character and story and Schumacher is no different, I believe another reviewer had the same thoughts as me on this one 'The Dark Knight in Technicolor'. For fans of the first two films this had to be a bit of a shock, new Batman and a real glossy comic book feel to the film. This was good escapism but lacked the mature approach of the first two films. Oh dear, with the final outing, Batman Forever, we see where Schumacher got his inspiration, not from the comics, not from the first films, oh no, anyone remember the campy, hammy Batman TV series with Burt Ward I believe?? Yup the only thing missing from this film were tights and the visual sound affects. POW BASH KA-BLAMMY. I strongly feel that the stars were wasted on this film, which is a great pity as there is far more potential to this series than has been shown thus far. In summery, the first two films are ideal teen upward viewing, the second two are in my opinion squarely aimed at kids.

The street parking in our F-250 extended cab ranch vehicle was... well, exciting, but do-able. Google Earth didn't show the degree of slope on the side we parked on (STEEP!). Once inside it was a great experience from check in to check out. The staff was all very polite and friendly. We declined the &quot;view&quot; room upgrade (for a fee) we were offered (didn't think work would go for that!), but our inside room was more than adequate. I could hear the gentleman next to us talk conversationally on his phone to someone named Chris so the rooms could use a little boost on the soundproofing, plus the pipes clanked pretty much all night. Maybe this was why we were offered an upgrade? In the evenings we were able to walk the neighborhood unmolested and gawk at the mansions in the 'hood- we probably got the police called on us as we ogled from the sidewalk (hey- they light those homes so you WILL ogle!). We were able to walk to the Fillmore district for dinner one night so it isn't totally far from restaurants, but you WILL burn off the calories from dinner. We also walked down to the waterfront area down the Lyon Street steps and caught the cable car over to Union Square for dinner and a pint at Johnny Foleys. One weird thing about parking at the hotel is that the parking is street parking and therefore under the parking laws- it must be moved every three hours after 9 in the morning.

I made our reservation well in advance and showed up prompt at 6:30pm. Although it was a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing. Our waiter was really attentive all night long and each dish came out in a timely manner giving us plenty of time to enjoy one before the next course arrived. I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet. I loved the bits of broken baklava to add some crunch and spots of chocolate sauce on plate to intensify the chocolate flavour.Burnt Honey Ice cream had a wonderful roasted honey flavourful with notes of vanilla and topped with a wedge of sponge toffee on top.Turkish Coffee Ice cream was soo creamy and rich with a chocolate base and notes coffee in the background topped with chocolate shavingsFinally I had a Moroccan Mint Tea to wash it all down which had a mild mint flavour served in glass tumbler piping hot with mint leaves floating on top was the perfect way to end a glorious meal.I can totally see why people are flocking here. This meal will definitely go down in one of my top 10 most memorable meals! The service here is top notch and the flavours are so unique and amazing.

It gives you a taste of where the story is headed and just grabs at your heart in a way that makes you just NEED to know more.When Sky meets Holder, her life changes. He is the first guy to make her heart skip a beat. The first guy to really make her FEEL.\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\"Dean Holder was absolutely amazing. With just a touch of bad boy, lickable dimples, a crooked smile and a tattoo, this moody, mysterious and endearing hot guy with a temper just utterly stole my heart.\"I saw a guy at the store after school, and holy s***, Six. He was beautiful. Scary, but beautiful....as soon as I looked at him, it was like my entire body melted to the floor. He was... Wow.\"Deeply protective and totally swoony but with a bad rep, he was so contradictory - warm, cold. Sweet, sharp. Just like Sky, I just NEEDED to know more about him. And the more I learned, the more the mystery deepened.I loved watching them get closer and closer. Their chemistry was undeniable and their dialogue and banter was rapid fire and brilliant and just set my heart a flutter.What they had was intense, passionate, and oh-so REAL. Every single thing they went though and did was believable and just made you wish you knew them in person.I loved that the story was serious but little parts made me laugh out, breaking up the more emotionally charged scenes. I swooned, squeed, proclaimed my undying love for the book, and had to take breathers to wipe the tears that sprung up on me more than once.I felt so in sync with Sky's emotions and journey. I felt like I went through all her emotions without ever once feeling disconnected. Through her eyes, I fell in love with Holder, I felt her pain and confusion, and I felt her healing. She was a wonderfully strong, brave heroine - the kind you want to look up to and make you feel proud of.This book has the. most. beautiful. intense. breathtaking. first kiss. EVER. (without actually kissing). Curious? You'll have to read it and see. But I am not kidding, it was one of the best written kisses I've ever read!I loved that the story was emotionally charged but with absolutely no stupidity. All the characters' reactions were understandable and just made me more and more sympathetic to them. This isn't to say that there wasn't angst and heart-clutching turmoil, because there was. The subject matter and themes are serious, gut wrenching and very mature. This book is definitely 17+.\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\"I have to say that I didn't see the big reveal coming. I had my suspicions about one part of the story, but the other part totally took me by surprise.All the pieces of the story just build and build, layer upon layer of things you don't even realize are important until the secrets come out and the cascade of emotions from them just crash into you and take your breath away.\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\"This is a quite simply a beautiful story about love and survival. About hope and healing. About life and death. About coping with tragedy and finding forgiveness and peace. About being strong. About being a victim, but also a survivor.I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.Every word, every sentence, every scene puts the imagery of the story into your head so vividly that you feel as though you are right there, watching the events unfold.This book NEEDS to be made into a movie!!This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever.And yes, there is a HEA :)\"F**k all the firsts, Sky.

What she did not expect was the unexpected feelings that she would have for him or the emotional roller coaster that she needed to strap in for. Remington has strong mood swings and he knows he has finally found the one in Brooke, but he is scared that his disease will make him hurt Brooke and she is the one he is willing to fight the hardest for!*Brooke: \"I know they're worried this will end badly. I'm Remington's employee and only a temporary one, and he has a bad reputation with tons of evidence behind it. He obviously has a little bit of a temper and can prove to be too hot to handle. But even though he's so strong, I know instinctively that he'd never hurt me, and he's never done anything to demonstrate otherwise. The rest doesn't matter right now. It just doesn't matter to me at all. I want him. With a force I haven't felt in over six years. And I'm going to go for it.\"As Brooke starts to peel the layers back and sees not only Remington's beautiful blue eyes but also his black eyes she starts to realize that their love maybe one of the most complicated things in her life but it's something she won't walk away from. Right in the middle of this love affair Brooke gets herself into a difficult situation while trying to save her sister from a life she isn't supposed to be in. Will she be able to save her while also protecting Remington? When things finally start to go right with Brooke and Remington everything comes crashing down. Remington's only fear is too loose Brooke but after many promises to be his will she walk away and leave him like everyone else in his life has done including his parents?*Brooke: \"You are the most beautifully complicated, gentle fighter I've ever known.\" \"But I can't stay anymore, Remy. I can't watch you hurt yourself, because when you do, you're hurting me in ways I never thought anybody could hurt me, and I'm afraid of breaking and never being right again.\"I personally loved this book. After dealing with a family member with Bipolar for the past 11 years I connected with this book in many ways. Seeing how scared Remington was of hurting his loved ones and even worse knowing how afraid he was that he wouldn't remember anything that he had done. Then watching how Brooke had to figure out how to handle Remington, knowing she would never know what kind of mood he was in, she truly became his anchor. I gave this book a 4.5 and can't wait to read the follow up book written in Remington's point of view called \"REMY,\" and then the continuation of Brooke and Remington's relationship, \"MINE (REAL Love Story),\" coming in 2013!", "domain": "books", "id": "e3afdeac5a0498d67a5d95f86734cc3b", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "bit", "nn_mod": "little", "q_reviews_id": "471e8baea877a79d6b4d2baa242efaba", "query_asp": "character", "query_mod": "smart", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is character?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "15adb73e16f4f7d399593c2962f4bd34", "title": "1476755590", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [523], "text": ["Chad"]}, "context": "The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion.

The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments.

Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'.

He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds.

Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick.

This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated.

Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.", "id": "5acd9d2807355d001abf482a", "question": "In what year did the Queen of Scotland inherit the Crown of England?", "title": "British_Isles", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0, "domain": null, "is_ques_subjective": null, "nn_asp": null, "nn_mod": null, "q_reviews_id": null, "query_asp": null, "query_mod": null, "ques_subj_score": null, "question_subj_level": null, "review_id": null}]}
